# Interpretation of ANCOVA summary:
# The p-value for the method variable indicates whether there are statistically significant differences 
# in completion_time between construction methods A, B, and C after adjusting for project_budget.
# If the p-value is less than 0.05, we would conclude that there is a significant difference in completion_time 
# between the construction methods.

# Fit MANCOVA model

# MANCOVA summary
summary_mancova <- summary(model_mancova, "Wilks")

# Interpretation of MANCOVA summary:
# The p-value for the method variable indicates whether there are statistically significant differences 
# in the combined dependent variables (completion_time and safety_incidents) between construction methods A, B, and C
# after adjusting for project_budget.
# If the p-value is less than 0.05, we would conclude that there is a significant difference in the combined
# dependent variables between the construction methods.
