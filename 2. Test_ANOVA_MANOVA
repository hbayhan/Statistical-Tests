# Fit ANOVA model

# Interpretation of ANOVA summary:
# The p-value for the method variable indicates whether there are statistically significant differences 
# in completion_time between construction methods A, B, and C.
# If the p-value is less than 0.05, we would conclude that there is a significant difference in completion_time 
# between the construction methods.

# Fit MANOVA model
model_manova <- manova(cbind(completion_time, safety_incidents) ~ method, data = data)

# MANOVA summary
summary_manova <- summary(model_manova, "Wilks")
print(summary_manova)

# Interpretation of MANOVA summary:
# The p-value for the method variable indicates whether there are statistically significant differences 
# in the combined dependent variables (completion_time and safety_incidents) between construction methods A, B, and C.
# If the p-value is less than 0.05, we would conclude that there is a significant difference in the combined
# dependent variables between the construction methods.
