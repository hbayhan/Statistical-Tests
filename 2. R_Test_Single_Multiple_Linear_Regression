# Fit single linear regression model
model_single <- lm(completion_time ~ project_budget, data = data)

# Single linear regression summary
summary_single <- summary(model_single)
print(summary_single)

# Interpretation of single linear regression summary:
# The p-value for the project_budget variable indicates whether there is a statistically significant relationship
# between project_budget and completion_time.
# If the p-value is less than 0.05, we would conclude that there is a significant relationship between
# project_budget and completion_time.

# Fit multiple linear regression model
model_multiple <- lm(completion_time ~ method + project_budget, data = data)

# Multiple linear regression summary
summary_multiple <- summary(model_multiple)
print(summary_multiple)

# Interpretation of multiple linear regression summary:
# The p-values for the method and project_budget variables indicate whether there are statistically significant relationships 
# between each of these independent variables and completion_time.
# If the p-value for each variable is less than 0.05, we would conclude that there is a significant relationship between 
# the independent variable and completion_time.
