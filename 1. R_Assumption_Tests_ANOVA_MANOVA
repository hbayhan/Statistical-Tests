# If the assumptions are violated after adding the outlier, consider the following:
# 1. Remove the outlier if it is not relevant to the research question or is a result of data entry error.
# 2. Transform the data to minimize the impact of the outlier.
# 3. Use non-parametric alternatives or robust methods that are less sensitive to outliers.
